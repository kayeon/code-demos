      <h1>CUTTLEFISHEZ:</h1>
      <h3>Real O.G. Mutha######s of the Ocean</h3>
      <p> Cuttlefish can change their color, texture, and even shape at will. They can also squirt
  ink jets to deter predators. Male cuttlefish court their mates through architecture
  and/or advanced mimicry. They have huge brains, which allow them to spend their
  short lives, much shorter than those of comparably advanced vertebrates, contemplating
  their mortality, their spinelessness, and the absurd tragedy of existence. </p>
